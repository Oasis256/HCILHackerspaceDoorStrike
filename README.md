HackerspaceDoorStrike

UMD HCIL Hackerspace Doorstrike system

Created by High School interns Jamie Gilkeson, Ji Bae, and Ben Holland, as well as UMD Intern Victor Chen. This system
was created to provide magcard reader access to the hackerspace built by Dr. Jon Froehlich in the UMD Human Computer 
Interaction Laboratory. The instructions for how to implement this code can be found in our instructable: 

Questions can be directed to me, and will be passed on to the appropriate party.
